# 3D-Printer-help
Not sure if I am doing this right but i am looking for some help. I have a Tronxy X5SA 330x330x400 3d printer with the CXY-V6-191017 motherboard with Marlin 2.0 Firmware.
I have a couple issues that I cannot figure out.
1. when I turn the printer on it only reconizes one corner of the print bed. I checked the confige settings and it is set to 330x330x400. I am not sure where else to look.
2. my other problem is while it is printing my print head keeps sinking lower into my project. My z offset is at -5.5 and in a span of 30 minutes I have to adjust it clear back to 0 and at that point void the project because it isn't printed well.
Any help with either problem is appreciated.
